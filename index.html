        <p>As a unicyclist, I’m no stranger to the challenges that come with riding uphill. It can be exhausting, and it’s easy to get discouraged and want to give up. But over the years, I’ve learned a few strategies that have helped me overcome this. First and foremost, it’s important to pace yourself and stay focused on your goal. Don’t worry about how far you have to go, just focus on making progress one pedal stroke at a time. It’s also helpful to use your body weight to your advantage by leaning forward and engaging your core; and obviously don’t forget to breathe! Deep, steady breaths can help you maintain your focus and keep your energy levels up. With practice and persistence, you’ll find that your technical ability improves greatly and consistently, and the feeling of accomplishment you get when you reach the top and get ripped thighs is WELL worth the effort.
